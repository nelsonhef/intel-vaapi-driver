# Intel VA-API driver for legacy hardware.

This is a fork with many changes, including but not limited to:

- Functioning Chromium support [✻]
- Fix JPEG decoding of oddly encoded files on gen7/8 (https://github.com/intel/intel-vaapi-driver/pull/514)
- fix exporting buffers with 3 planes and `VA_EXPORT_SURFACE_SEPARATE_LAYERS` (https://github.com/intel/intel-vaapi-driver/pull/530)
- `i965_pci_ids`: Add CFL PCI ID found on Xeon W-1290P (https://github.com/intel/intel-vaapi-driver/pull/548)
- Make wl_drm optional (https://github.com/intel/intel-vaapi-driver/pull/566)
- Expose `VAConfigAttribMaxPictureWidth` and `VAConfigAttribMaxPictureHeight`.
- Full support for `vaSyncBuffer`, `vaSyncSurface2` and `vaMapBuffer2`. (enabling `async_depth` in FFMPEG)
- More accurate per-codec limits.
- Improved hybrid codec driver support.
- Expose ARGB format support. (https://github.com/intel/intel-vaapi-driver/issues/500)

The `NEWS` file contains a more detailed changelog.

[✻] Works on IVB and newer, broken on SNB and ILK (for now)

# Release schedule

This driver has a single digit count of planned releases, after that this driver will too be strictly
in maintenance mode, since it's basically feature complete.

Until maintenance mode is reached, the driver will continue to increment on the `2.4.x` version branch,
and then bump the version to `2.5.x` where only fixes for regressions and critical issues will be accepted.

# Reporting issues

- Reproducers are highly welcome (i don't like seeing "it doesn't work")
- Sample footage (if possible) for any fork regressions are welcome
- Remember that I am just some random person on the Internet.

[1] - Intel's hardware encoder uses GPU resources during an encode, high GPU load can cause bad encoding performance.

[2] - "Hybrid" support only, known to be buggy.

[3] - Supported by the iHD driver, **you shouldn't be using this driver**

[4] - Supports Low Power encoders, which fully offload the work without using GPU resources.

[5] - Supports VP9 natively.

[6] - Encoding is supported by this driver, known to be buggy. Likely safe up to 1920x1080 at 60 FPS.

## How to build

## Get

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nelsonhef/intel-vaapi-driver.git
```
## Get dependencies

For example in Ubuntu 24.04 or 22.04

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential pkgconf autoconf libtool -y
sudo apt install libdrm-dev libva-dev libx11-dev -y
```

## Build

```sh
cd intel-vaapi-driver
./autogen.sh
./configure LIBVA_DRIVERS_PATH="$(pwd)/../intel-vaapi-driver"
make install -j $(nproc)
```

The outcome can be found at `intel-vaapi-driver/i965_drv_video.so`.

## Use

For example on Ubuntu the `i965-va-driver` package installs a single file `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so`. Replacing the file with this modified version.

Make copies first

```sh
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so-ubuntu
sudo cp intel-vaapi-driver/i965_drv_video.so /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so-modified
```

You can switch between the upstream and modified driver with

```sh
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so-ubuntu /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so
```

and

```sh
sudo cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so-modified /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/i965_drv_video.so
```

## Check if it works

```sh
vainfo
```
